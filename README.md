# Spring-Boot-CRUD-Repo

 This is an Eclipse project. Nevertheless, it can be used via console, or imported into NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA.
Libraries are imported via Maven to ease dependency management. You should always use the newest version of dependency before starting.

This Rest Application is used to perform all crud operation on BookEntity.
You can get Book info data on the basis of different criteria.

Run & Put a breakpoint into the debugger and start playing around. This is very simple example for getting started.
